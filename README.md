The project titled "Real-Time Hand Movement Recognition for Rehabilitation Using Image Processing" is dedicated to the creation of an advanced system leveraging MediaPipe and Python for the precise detection of hand movements. By harnessing live video streams from a webcam, the system employs MediaPipe's capabilities to accurately discern the intricate hand skeleton, enabling subsequent angle calculations between various hand joints. This methodology facilitates the determination of the hand's degree of extension in real-time, alongside a meticulous tallying of complete hand openings and closures. Such a comprehensive approach holds profound implications for rehabilitation practices, offering therapists and patients a robust toolset for monitoring progress, designing tailored interventions, and optimizing rehabilitation outcomes. With its potential to provide granular insights into hand movement patterns, this research endeavors to significantly enhance the efficacy and efficiency of rehabilitation protocols, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and well-being.
